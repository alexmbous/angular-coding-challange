# AngularCodingChallenge

This project was was built for a coding challenge for a company with a front end language I have never used before.  
I spent the first hour trying to get my local environment right with the Ionic and Angular to be able to build the project and view it locally. This was a failure. 
I spent the remaining 3 hours building the individual portions of the test without being able to run the build locally. 
Without ever using Ionic before, I found through the research of the framework and online docs that it is a pretty great software. 
The ease of use and logic attached to it made it for quicker development time than other javascript libraries out there. Although I found it interesting, I was not able to complete the project in time. 
With more hands on time with the language and a better understanding of how to set up the environment, I believe I would have been able to complete the project in the time frame.

·       As a developer, I want an Angular service to consume the NDB REST API.  
·       As a developer, I want the data to be saved to and retrieved from the browser's local storage.
